- üü° **Orange Circle**: Ready to start / Stopped
- üî¥ **Red Circle**: Error occurred

### 3. Hand Gesture Controls

#### Steering

- Hold both hands as if gripping a steering wheel
- Rotate hands left/right to steer
- The app will calibrate your neutral position automatically

#### Acceleration & Braking

- **Both Thumbs UP**: Idle/Coast (no input)
- **Left Thumb UP + Right Thumb DOWN**: Accelerate
- **Left Thumb DOWN + Right Thumb UP**: Brake
- **Both Thumbs DOWN**: Handbrake/Emergency brake

#### Additional Controls

- **Left Index Finger UP**: A Button (for menu navigation)
- **ESC Key**: Exit the Python detection window

### 4. Calibration Process

When you click START:

1. **Calibration Phase**: Hold hands in comfortable steering position
2. **Progress Bar**: Shows calibration progress (0-100%)
3. **Completion**: System learns your neutral hand position
4. **Active Phase**: Begin controlling your game

### 5. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**‚ùå Python not found**

- Install Python 3.7+ from https://python.org
- Make sure "Add to PATH" is checked during installation
- Restart command prompt after installation

**‚ùå Camera not working**

- Check camera permissions in Windows Settings
- Close other applications using the camera
- Try a different USB port for external cameras
- Update camera drivers

**‚ùå Game not responding**

- Ensure your game supports Xbox controllers
- Check game controller settings
- Try starting the game after AirSync is running
- Some games may need to be restarted to detect the virtual controller

**‚ùå Poor hand tracking**

- Improve lighting (avoid backlighting)
- Keep hands within camera frame
- Remove background clutter
- Ensure good contrast between hands and background

**‚ùå Jerky/Unstable control**

- Adjust STEERING_SENSITIVITY in test.py (lower = less sensitive)
- Increase DEAD_ZONE for more stability
- Ensure steady hand movements

#### Performance Tips

- **Lighting**: Use good, even lighting from the front
- **Camera Position**: Place camera at eye level when hands are in driving position
- **Background**: Use a plain background behind your hands
- **Hand Position**: Keep hands clearly visible and separated
- **Clothing**: Avoid wearing gloves or jewelry that might interfere

### 6. Advanced Configuration

#### Modifying Settings

Edit `test.py` to adjust these parameters:

```python
# Sensitivity and response
STEERING_SENSITIVITY = 3.0      # Higher = more sensitive steering
DEAD_ZONE = 5.0                # Degrees to ignore (prevents jitter)
WHEEL_ROTATION_SMOOTHING = 0.8  # Smoothing factor (0-1)

# Detection thresholds
THUMB_EXTENSION_THRESHOLD = 0.08   # Thumb up/down sensitivity
FINGER_EXTENSION_THRESHOLD = 0.1   # Index finger detection

# Calibration
CALIBRATION_FRAMES = 60         # Frames for neutral position learning
```

#### Game Compatibility

AirSync emulates an Xbox 360 controller with these mappings:

- **Left Joystick X-Axis**: Steering
- **Right Trigger**: Acceleration
- **Left Trigger**: Brake
- **Y Button**: Handbrake
- **A Button**: Menu/Action button
